A quick set of steps to getting up and running with jupyter notebooks on your computer


# Docker
Docker runs natively on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  Find the appropriate version for your computer here: 
- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
- Docker for Linux: [go here and find your distro](https://docs.docker.com/)

I recommend using the “stable” branch. Make sure you have about 10 gigabytes of disk space free, then follow the installation instructions. 
[In addition to the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/), here’s [a cheat sheet](https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet) for when you want to explore more.]
